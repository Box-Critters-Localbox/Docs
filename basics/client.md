# Client

### Description

Box Critter's client was written with Typescript & CreateJS [(documentation)](https://createjs.com/). In the beta, RocketSnail has confirmed that he has moved to PixiJS [(documentation)](https://pixijs.com/) for client development.

### Versions

The client went through 180 versions during the public alpha testing. Not all versions of the client were major, and not all were archived.

The fan-made wiki for the game has a change-log for most of the early versions, which you can check out [here](https://box-critters.fandom.com/wiki/Release_Log). Eventually, I plan to make a more comprehensive change-log with more in-depth information on more of the later versions that aren't explained on the wiki's change-log.

> TO-DO: upload the latest known archived version of each known client version to a public GitHub repository and then link the files here
